# Facial Emotion Depth Index

## Project Overview

In this research endeavor, we
embark on a fresh approach aimed at discerning emotions and
gauging their intensity through the utilization of an innovative
emotion depth index. By forecasting continuous values that
mirror the magnitude of emotion, this methodology affords a
heightened level of precision and a more intricate
comprehension of an individual’s emotional state. Furthermore,
this study delves into the potential real-world applications of this
technology, spanning from psychological counseling and
customer service to market research.
